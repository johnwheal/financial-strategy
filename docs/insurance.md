# Insurance

## General Insurance Principles

Insurance **shall** be purchased to fulfil all legal obligations.

Insurance **should** be purchased if the worst case scenario cannot be covered under provisions set out in the [Emergency Scenarios](/emergency) section.

Insurance **may** be purchased if there is a genuine belief that it is conceivable that an insurance claim may be required and it would be more economical to take out the insurance[^3].

[^3]: When enacted, this statement **shall** overwrite the previous statement

## Insurance Cover & Excess

The following **shall** apply once a decision is made to purchase insurance.

Quotes from multiple insurance providers **should** be obtained and the cheapest opiton selected.

When the option is available, and providing it is not more expensive, insurance **should** be paid monthly and not annually.

Unless deemed inappropriate, the top level of insurance cover **should** be selected.

When the insurance excess is selectable:

* The excess **should** not be more than Â£500[^2]
* A higher excess is preferred but **should** be set on a case-by-case basis
* Unless free, an excess waiver **should** not be used

[^2]: If applicable, the sum of voluntary and mandatory excess should not exceed this value

## Travel Insurance

Worldwide travel insurance **should** be purchased on an annual, not per trip basis[^1].

[^1]: Specialist travel insurance (e.g. winter sports) **may** be included if applicable
