## Allocating Money

This section needs to be written

## Temporary Pots

The following temporary pots **shall** be used to aid with budgeting by storing money which has been allocated but not yet used for:

* **Events**: items which will be categorised as "Events"
* **Technology**: items which will be categorised as "Technology"
* **House**: items which will be categorised as "Strategic House"
* **Holiday**: items which will be categorised as "House"
* **Hobbies**: items which will be categorised as "Special hobbies"
* **Bills**: holding money temporarily prior to a bill being paid[^2]
* **Hold**: holding money on a short-term basis
[^2]: This should balance to zero each month

Other pots **should** not be used/created.

Where there is an expectation that Â£500 or more is stored in a pot for longer than 90 days, an interest pot **may** be used [^1].

[^1]: When an interest pot is used, the original pot **should** be hidden and not deleted
