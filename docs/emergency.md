# Emergency Scenarios

## Emergency Savings

Emergency Savings **shall** be kept at a baseline[^3] level of £5,500.

Emergency Savings **shall** rise on a monthly basis in line with inflation.

Emergency Savings **shall** be kept in cash.

Emergency Savings **should** receive interest at a competitive rate.

At least 70% of Emergency Savings **shall** be accessible immediately.

All Emergency Savings **shall** be accessible within six months.

[^3]: I.e. when no emergency expenses have been incurred

## Unexpected Expenses

*An unexpected expense is defined as an expense that was reasonably unforeseen. For example, the payment of insurance excess following an accident.*

An unexpected expense under £400 **should** be paid using standard monthly budgeting[^1].

[^1]: This would likely be instead of allocating money to strategic/long-term spending

An unexpected expense between £400 and £1,5000 **may** borrow money from Emergency Savings and **shall** be paid back within one year.

An unexpected expense between £1,500 and £5,500 **may** borrow money from Emergency Savings and **shall** be paid back within three years.

An unexpected expense over £5,500 **shall** be handled on a case-by-case basis[^2].

[^2]: Following analysis, it is believed that multiple unexpected expenses would have needed to occur in this scenario
